## Visualization notebooks are on the visualizations folder
The folder `visualizations/exports` have the scatter charts generated by the jupyter nb "engine_metadata_analysis.ipynb", it can help answer the question:

- __How do the effience of each type of engine compare between clients?__

For example, each client who has the "ENGINE_1", has a different __mean__ thermal efficiency between all the "ENGINE_1" he has, so they have the engines working in different conditions, so maybe (without considering the geography of the zone) based on oher customers working conditions we can recommend the client the power, speed and flow that can maximize the efficiency, and if it is maximized, the cost of running it is minimized.

In the other hand, the other notebooks "Analizando_Engine3_BTU.ipynb" contain a time-series analysis in order to predict how the efficience decays in some period of time, in order to tell the client when to change the engine in order to save money.
